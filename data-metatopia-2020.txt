"How To Pitch Your Game"
presented by Alex Cutler, Matt Forbeck, Kenneth Hite. 
You made a game! Congratulations! Now explain your incredible game in one sentence. That isn’t as easy as it sounds. You want people to buy into your game as players, as investors, or as retailers. You will only have one chance to make that first impression. It needs to have impact. If you want to see your game successful on a crowdfunding site, or sold by your local game store, then you need to know what kind of pitch types and styles to maximize both what you say and target the right audience.

"Carved In Stone: Deconstructing Scottish History Through TTRPGs"
presented by Jeff Sanders, Lizy Simonen, Justin Wigard, Nathan Blades, Lloyd Gyan, Sally Pentecost, Brian Tyrrel. 
Carved in Stone is a project combining contemporary archaeologists with diverse creatives to help contextualise and digest Scotland's rich past. Specifically looking at the 8-9th century's, CiS explores the melting pot that was Proto-Scotland- Celtic tribes, a receding Roman empire leaving Moorish and African soldiers stranded, a mythical cult to Mythras, Viking traders and many more cultures met in these rain stricken mountains. Yet, we hardly know about any of this, because so much of Scotland's history has been dictated by armchair white historians. This round table would talk about a lot of the issues in Scottish history, as well as shed light on exciting and new discoveries that make the period ideal to re-explore and understand through the lived experiences of role playing games. We'll also aim to talk about (mis)representation, both in games and in history!

Or the often chaotic and experimental nature of the playtest experience? This roundtable will start out with the two facilitators discussing their own strategies for creating spaces for online playtests, gathering feedback in a way that works around the "only one person can talk" nature of online communication, recruiting techniques, and other methods to mitigate the challenges of online playtest versus face-to-face. We will then open up the table to share how others have navigated the transition to online playtesting, success and challenges encountered.

presented by Richard Ruane, Brian Yaksha, Zedeck Siew, Amanda Franck, Pamela Punzalan.
Microsettings (settings that focus closely on a specific area, region, or location) can be a powerful touchstone for game design. By focusing their attention and concerns on a small region, city, or even places as focused as a bar, a school, or a shopping center, microsettings give the smaller, more particular stories a space to happen. In the panel, we'd like to discuss how designing and detailing of focused microsettings can evoke a location's multiplicity and diversity, make the world of the game more accessible and real, challenge characters to form relationships within the setting, and invoke curiosity about mundane aspects of setting life.

presented by Anne Ratchat, Spider Perry, Misha Bushyager, Mids Meinberg, Pamela Punzalan.
For all the merits of the genre, it is not an exaggerated statement to say that horror is the least accessible genres in analog gaming.

"Shores Not Quite Undiscovered: Tabletop Beyond America"
presented by Pamela Punzalan, Vince Smith, Alastor Guzman, Sangjung Park.

Hear perspectives from a clinician who uses games as part of nontraditional play therapy with 2 to 5 year olds, a parent who uses games and game pieces for toddler sensory needs and social development, and a game designer who creates games with preschooler sensory needs in mind. We will also discuss how to notice and meet sensory needs in children (and yourself!). Grab some dice or game components for your own sensory input during the panel!

"Games Are Art: Designing Through An Artist's Lens"
presented by Curt Covert, Julie Ahern. 
When you think of art, you think of music, theater, painting, sculpting, writing, film. And at the heart of each is an artist, who uses their talents, creativity, skill and intelligence to craft something that never existed before, with the intent of sharing a vision, a feeling, a message, a sense of discovery or connection. The games we create are no less an art form, and we designers no less than artists. What we craft brings people together for a shared experience and has the ability to do more than challenge us mentally, pass the time or entertain, but to connect emotionally with people. Let us view game design through an artistic lens, to look past the mathematical underpinnings, and dive into what makes games a uniquely human endeavor.

Neurodiversity refers to the reality of diversity of minds and the goal of human rights and dignity for people whose brains work atypically. However, neurodiversity is rarely explicitly represented in games, nor are the accessibility needs of neurodivergent players specifically accounted for. This exploratory guided discussion between neurodivergent discussion facilitators and participants of all neurotypes will cover questions of how to address these deficiencies in representation and inclusion, as well as talk about how games can and have been helpful for neurodivergent players for personal growth. We will also discuss how we can tap into the medium of analog games to celebrate neurodiversity and make neurodivergent players feel welcome, and even create games where atypical minds are centered.
